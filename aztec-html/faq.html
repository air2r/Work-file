<h4>What is CBD?</h4>
       <p>CBD Oil is a nutritional supplement derived from non-psychoactive hemp. It is a natural constituent of hemp oil. To learn more about CBD, read the What is CBD? – Section.</p>
       <h4>Is CBD legal in the UK?</h4>
       <p>Yes, CBD is 100% legal</p>
       <p>None of our products contain THC. We do not sell Marijuana or any products that violate the United Kingdom Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.</p>
       <h4>Legality outside of the UK?</h4>
       <p>The legality of CBD differs from country to country and is constantly changing – so much that it is impossible for us to keep up-to-date with each country’s individual legality status at any given time. Therefore, we are happy to ship to any country but asking each customer to get familiar with their own country’s legislation regarding CBD before ordering.</p>
       <h4>What is CBD used for?</h4>
       <p>We have chosen not to make any health claims. Instead, we encourage you to do your own research and to educate yourself as to how Cannabidiol (CBD) may affect the human system.</p>
       <h4>Will CBD get me high?</h4>
       <p>No! Since AZTEC CBD products does not contain any THC, it is therefore impossible to get high from our products.</p>
       <h4>How long does it for CBD to take affect?</h4>
       <p>Eating it as-is (or through delicious products like our CBD chocolate or our high-CBD hemp oil) takes longer, from <strong>20 minutes </strong>to an hour, depending on how much you ate before and how long ago your last meal was. It is best to take CBD oil on an empty stomach for faster effect.</p>
       <h4>Is CBD Legal?</h4>
       <p>This is a question we get asked all the time. So, what does the current UK law state about the legality of CBD Oil, Hemp and Cannabis?</p>
       <p>The short answer is that Cannabidiol (CBD) is not considered a controlled substance in the UK. It is therefore 100% legal and can be freely distributed in the UK without restrictions. </p>
       <h4>The Cannabis Plant?</h4>
       <p>Cannabis is one of the oldest domesticated crops. Throughout history, all civilisations have grown different varieties of cannabis for both industrial and medicinal uses.</p>
       <p>The cannabis plant contains unique compounds called cannabinoids. Current research has revealed over 60 different cannabinoids so far. THC is the most abundant constituent of the cannabis plant, and the most well-known. THC is responsible for causing the marijuana high.</p>
       <h4>Hemp?</h4>
       <p>This strain of the cannabis plant is grown for industrial uses such as foods, oils, textiles and ropes etc. It is a much taller and sturdier version of the plant. It is generally much thinner with smaller and fewer attention-grabbing flowers. It has been bred for many generations with other plants with similar characteristics, leading to the type of cannabis we now know as hemp.</p>
       <p>Hemp contains no, or very little THC, the psychoactive chemical. Marijuana on the other hand contains high levels of the psychoactive chemical. This single difference is what most relies on to distinguish between hemp and marijuana.</p>
       <p>The lawmakers don’t care about how tall the plant is, or even how many flowers it produces. They care whether the public can get high from smoking it or not.</p>
       <p>Therefore, the UK has set the maximum THC content of hemp at 0.2%. Any cannabis with higher THC is considered marijuana, and is therefore considered illegal.</p>
       <h4>Marijuana?</h4>
       <p>This strain of the cannabis plant is grown for medicinal and recreational purposes. It has flowering buds and is smaller than hemp.</p>
       <p>It is high in Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive chemical responsible for causing the Marijuana high. And it is prohibited under current UK legislation.</p>
       <p>Cannabidiol (CBD) is not considered a controlled substance in the UK, and is therefore 100% legal.</p>
       <p>Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the psychoactive chemical responsible for causing the marijuana high, and is illegal.</p>
       <p>The UK has set the maximum THC content of hemp at 0.2%. Therefore, any Hemp oil with higher THC than 0.2% is considered medical marijuana instead, and is therefore illegal under current UK law. Consider this when purchasing CBD Oil, and read more about what other factors to consider in our CBD Buying Guide.</p>
       <h4>Legality outside of the UK?</h4>
       <p>The legality of CBD differs from country to country and is constantly changing – so much that it is impossible for us to keep up-to-date with each country’s individual legality status at any given time. Therefore, we are happy to ship to any country but asking each customer to get familiar with their own country’s legislation regarding CBD before ordering.</p>
